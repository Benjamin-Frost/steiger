# `public-api`

Require slices (and segments on sliceless layers like Shared) to have a public API definition.

According to the _public API rule on slices_:

> Every slice (and segment on layers that don't have slices) must contain a public API definition.
>
> Modules outside of this slice/segment can only reference the public API, not the internal file structure of the slice/segment.
> https://feature-sliced.design/docs/reference/slices-segments#public-api-rule-on-slices

Examples of project structures that pass this rule:

```md
📂 shared
📂 ui
📄 index.ts
📂 lib
📄 index.ts
📂 entities
📂 user
📂 ui
📂 model
📄 index.ts
📂 pages
📂 home
📂 ui
📄 index.ts
```

Examples of project structures that fail this rule:

```md
📂 shared
📂 ui // ❌
📄 Button.tsx
📂 lib
📄 index.ts
📂 entities
📂 user // ❌
📂 ui
📂 model
📂 pages
📂 home
📂 ui
📄 index.ts
```

## Rationale

The public API for slices exists as the only entrypoint into a slice, and that ensures that the internal structure of the slice can change freely as long as the public API stays the same. This ensures stability of the codebase during refactors. A slice that doesn't have one becomes a weak point for refactoring.
